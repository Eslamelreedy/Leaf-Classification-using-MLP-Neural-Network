# Leaf-Classification-using-MLP-Neural-Network
Leaf Classification using MLP Neural Network is a project that aims to accurately classify different types of leaves based on their image features. Through data preparation, training an MLP neural network, and hyperparameter exploration, the project strives to optimize model performance for effective leaf classification.

## Project Description:
This project focuses on building a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model to classify leaf images in the Leaf Classification dataset. The goal is to accurately classify different types of leaves based on their image features using deep learning techniques. The project involves data preparation, model training, and hyperparameter exploration to optimize the performance of the MLP model.

## Getting Started:
Follow the instructions below to get started with the project:

1. Download the Leaf Classification dataset.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow).
3. Run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook to execute the project code.

## Data Preparation:
1. Download the dataset and load it into memory.
2. Perform data cleaning by checking for missing values or duplicates.
3. Visualize the data using appropriate visualization methods to gain insights.
4. Split the data into training and test sets (80:20 ratio) while maintaining class distribution.
5. Standardize the data by computing the mean and standard deviation using the training set.

## Model Training:
1. Implement a 3-layer MLP model using the built-in modules in Keras.
2. Write the training function to train the MLP model.
3. Explore different hyperparameter settings, including batch size, hidden size, dropout rate, optimizer, regularization, and learning rate.
4. Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the train and test sets.

## Evaluation and Results:
1. Implement the evaluation function to load the trained model and assess its performance.
2. Document the hyperparameters explored and the accuracy achieved on the train and test sets.
3. Provide insights into the impact of different hyperparameter settings on model performance.
