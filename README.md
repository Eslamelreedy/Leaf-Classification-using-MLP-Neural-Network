# Leaf-Classification-using-MLP-Neural-Network
Leaf Classification using MLP Neural Network is a project that aims to accurately classify different types of leaves based on their image features. Through data preparation, training an MLP neural network, and hyperparameter exploration, the project strives to optimize model performance for effective leaf classification.
